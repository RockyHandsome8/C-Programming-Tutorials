    following are the bitwise operators:

    &, |, <<, >>, ~, ^

    &  = AND
    |  = OR
    ~  = NOT
    << = Left Shift
    >> = Right Shift
    ^  = XOR

    -> The & (bitwise AND) in C takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. 
       The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
    -> The | (bitwise OR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. 
       The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 
    -> The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. 
       The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 
    -> The << (left shift) in C takes two numbers, the left shifts the bits of the first operand, and 
       the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
    -> The >> (right shift) in C takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the 
       second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
    -> The ~ (bitwise NOT) in C takes one number and inverts all bits of it.


    Letâ€™s look at the truth table of the bitwise operators.
